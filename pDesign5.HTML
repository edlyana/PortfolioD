                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I designed a personalized name card to reflect my personality and personal brand. As a young polytechnic student, I aim to showcase my creativity and fresh ideas while 
                    maintaining a professional image for potential employers.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="goals">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>The goal was to create a name card that balances professionalism with a touch of fun, aligning with my identity as an innovative and approachable individual.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="process">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I started by creating a moodboard to guide the design. The chosen palette incorporates serious tones (blue, grey, and black) with 
                    complementary fun elements (yellow and orange). This combination achieves a minimalist design that is professional yet lively.</p>
                <p>To ensure clarity and readability, I used the Inter font for its clean and modern appearance, avoiding extra embellishments on the 
                    lettering. I also focused on making the card easy to print while maintaining visual appeal.</p>
                <div>
                    <img style="height:450px; width:700px" src="/images/pDesign5c.png" alt="Design Project 5">
                </div>
                <p>Next, I sketched up potential designs for the name card (toggle through the dropdown below!):</p>

                <button class="accordion">Sketch 1</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <img src="images/pDesign5_1.png" alt="Sketch 1">
                    <p>I tried to achieve balance with the back of the card by arranging my details from top right to center left and bottom right we have the logo 
                        again. I also made use the spacing between the components to categorize the contact details away from the main name and designation for a more organized look.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Sketch 2</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <img src="images/pDesign5_2.png" alt="Sketch 1">
                    <p>I have included an element of programming in the card, which is the brackets (at the front and back of the card), to represent the beginning and end 
                        of the card. This is to show continuity that there is still more to see behind the card. I have placed the name at the top to show emphasis that this card belongs to me.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Sketch 3</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <img src="images/pDesign5_3.png" alt="Sketch 1">
                    <p>I introduced a new shape (circle), to add an element of fun into the name card. The principle of similarity is achieved by the placement of the circles, overall forming the 
                        edges of a square. The other two circles are continued to the back of the card. I have compacted all details below each other in sequence to keep it simple and 
                        arranged the more important details at the top and so on.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Overall, I chose Sketch 3 because it has more personality and better represents my style.</p>

                for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
                acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {

            <section id="challenges">
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>A key challenge was integrating the cloud element of the logo with the word "nur." I experimented with Illustrator’s wrapping function and eventually 
                    achieved a design that felt cohesive and visually pleasing.</p>
                <div>
                    <img style="height:450px; width:700px" src="/images/pDesign5b.png" alt="Design Project 5">
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>For the front of the card, I used a crème background to provide a neutral yet warm base, allowing the moodboard colors to stand out. The placement of diagonal 
                    circular elements emphasizes the logo and directs attention to the center, where the essential details are displayed.</p>
                <p>The back of the card features a dark blue background that mirrors the inner color of the logo’s cloud. To maintain consistency, I used the same crème tone for the text 
                    as the front background. This cohesive design ties both sides of the card together, creating a unified and polished look that aligns with my personal branding.</p>
