                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I was tasked with creating a single-page web application using React to help travelers 
                    keep track of their packed items during their holidays.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="goals">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>My goal was to develop a minimalist, user-friendly application that simplifies the packing process for users.</p>
                <div><img src="images/pDigital4a.png"></div>
            </section>

            <section id="process">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I began by adding form elements, including a quantity dropdown, a text input field, and an add button. Each of these elements was connected to useState hooks with event handlers to ensure state updates.</p>
                <p>Next, I displayed the user-added items in a list format using the .map() function. Within this list, I included a checkbox to mark items as packed and a delete button (X) for removing individual items. A conditional style was applied to visually indicate packed items by striking through their descriptions.</p>

                <img style="width:750px; height:200px;" src="/images/pDigital4b.png">

                <p>I implemented a "delete all" function to clear the list entirely and created a status feature that calculates the percentage of items packed using a simple formula. A ternary operator was used to toggle between personalized messages when all items are packed.</p>

                <p>For deployment, I committed my code to our GitHub repo regularly and used Render to deploy our application for the first time.</p>

            <section id="challenges">
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>One challenge I faced was properly styling the packed items dynamically. Initially, I struggled to get the textDecoration: "line-through" style to apply only when the checkbox was ticked. By carefully reviewing how state updates work and ensuring the packed property of each item was toggled correctly, I managed to fix this issue.</p>
                <p>Another challenge I faced was deploying the app for the first time using Vercel. Watching tutorials and experimenting with the deployment process helped me successfully publish the application.</p>

                <p>The final product is a fully functional recipe web app, deployed for users to list down their recipes .</p>
