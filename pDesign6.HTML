                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I was approached by Travelly, a travel company, to design a series of digital banners aimed at boosting their online presence on both their website and social media platforms. In an increasingly competitive travel industry, Travelly aims to stand out with visually engaging and informative banners that highlight its core values of discovery, quality, and reliability.</p>

            <section id="goals">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>My goal was to help Travelly attract a diverse audience—adventure-seekers, families, and solo travelers—interested in exploring unique destinations worldwide. The banner, designed for both digital and physical ads, aimed to boost Travelly’s brand presence with aesthetic layouts. The yellow theme, inspired by the mascot— a character emerging from yellow paper—was used to maintain visual consistency. I applied the same colors, shapes, and fonts from the Instagram grid design to create a unified look across both platforms.</p>

            <section id="process">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The process began with sketching out the initial design concept. To enhance my skills, I completed LinkedIn Learning courses that focused on effectively using text, shapes, and layers in design. This helped me refine my approach and execute the design with greater precision and creativity.</p>

            <section id="challenges">
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>One of the main challenges was arranging the destinations in a way that was visually appealing and meaningful to the audience. It was important to not only create an attractive layout but also ensure that each destination was presented in a way that resonated with Travelly's diverse audience. I had to balance aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that the design was both eye-catching and easy to navigate, while effectively conveying the unique appeal of each destination.</p>

            <section id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>I used consistent colors and shapes to convey the fun and friendly nature of the travel agency. The same font style was applied throughout, with darker red used for text that highlights key information about the company's offerings. This design approach helped maintain visual harmony while ensuring the key details stood out.</p>
